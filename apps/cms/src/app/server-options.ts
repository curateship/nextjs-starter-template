/**
 * What this app changes about the shell, on the server side.
 *
 * The companion to `options.ts`. That file is seen by the browser, so it holds
 * the drawing and the wording; this one never is, so it holds the work — the
 * parts that reach the database or call something outside.
 *
 * Open `src/server/app-options.ts` for the full list of what can go in here and
 * what each one does. Anything not offered there is a compile error, on
 * purpose: the shell always knows every way an app can deviate from it.
 *
 * New server functions still go in `src/lib/api/`, never here: the guard test
 * only walks that folder, so an endpoint declared here would be an unguarded
 * door nobody is told about.
