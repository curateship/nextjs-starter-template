/**
 * The app's own entries in the guard test's two exception lists.
 *
 * `src/server/guards.test.ts` insists every server function either carries a
 * guard or is written down here with a reason. Its own lists cover the shell's
 * endpoints — but an app adds endpoints of its own, and some of them have to be
 * reachable by somebody who is not signed in: a public page that loads
 * anything at all needs a door the open internet may knock on. That entry
 * cannot go in the shell's lists, because the test is a shell file and an app
 * never edits one.
 *
 * So it goes here. Same rules as the shell's own lists, checked by the same
 * tests: the reason must be a real sentence over thirty characters, an entry
 * whose function no longer exists fails, and an entry whose function has since
 * grown a guard fails too.
 *
 * Keys are `file:functionName`, named the way the walker names them — the path
 * under `src/lib/api` and the constant, like
 * `"directory/listings.ts:readPublicListingFn"`.
 *
 * This file belongs to the app, not the shell. **In custom-shell itself it
 * stays empty forever.** The moment the shell puts an entry here, every app
 * ever copied from it conflicts on this file on every future merge — which is
 * the exact problem the file exists to avoid.
