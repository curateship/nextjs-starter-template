# Teams and invites

A team is the top level in Project. A team holds its people and its projects.
Project has no workspaces.

## One team per account

- **Each account belongs to one team.** Switching between teams is what a later
  workspace switcher would do, and version 1 doesn't build toward it.
- **Starting a team.** Anyone signed in who isn't on a team sees a "Start a
  team" card on Projects, Team and My work. Whoever starts the team is its
  owner.
- **What a team holds.** A name, a daily check-in time (9:00 to begin with), a
  time zone, and its work days (Monday to Friday to begin with). The check-in
  itself is task file 02. The time and days are stored now so the Team
  dashboard can show them.

## Roles

- **Owner.** Exactly one per team. The owner can do everything an admin can,
  and can hand the team to someone else. Handing it over makes the old owner an
  admin. The owner can't leave until someone else is the owner.
- **Admin.** Invites people, removes people, changes roles between admin and
  member, and edits the team's settings. An admin can't change or remove the
  owner.
- **Member.** Works on projects. Anyone, whatever their role, can make
  projects and tasks and hand tasks to anyone on the project.

## Invites

- **An invite is for one email address.** Only an account signed in with that
  address can accept it. The link expires after 7 days.
- **The link carries a secret.** The database only stores a fingerprint of the
  secret (a sha256 hash), so someone reading the database can't accept an
  invite with what they find there.
- **Inviting the same address again** replaces the old invite and its link.
  Resend on the Team dashboard does the same with a fresh link and 7 more days.
- **Email.** The invite goes through the email key saved in Settings → Email, or
  the `CUSTOM_SHELL_RESEND_API_KEY` setting. When neither is set, nothing is
  sent, and the invite window says so and shows the link to copy. The link is
  always shown, so it can be shared by hand either way.
- **How often invites can be sent.** Each person can send 30 invite emails an
  hour, and one address can receive at most 5 a day from all teams together.
  Resend counts too. The cap exists because anyone can start a team, so without
  it an invite would be a way to make Project email any address as often as
  someone liked. A refused send says to wait an hour.
- **Why invites skip the shell's system emails.** Adding an email type to the
  shell's list means editing shell files, which an app never does. The invite
  is sent with the same lower-level sender the CRM uses
  (`src/server/project/invite-email.ts`).
- **Two ways to accept.** The emailed link opens `/projects/invite/<secret>`.
  A signed-out visitor is sent to sign in and brought back. A brand-new account
  doesn't come back to the link, because `/register` doesn't remember where you
  were going. So any open invite to your address also shows at the top of the
  Projects page, with Join and Decline.
- **Someone already on a team** sees the invite with "Leave your current team
  to join this one", and Join is refused until they leave.

## Removing people

- **Removing someone or leaving** takes the person off every project in the
  team, then off the team. They lose access at once.
- **Their tasks stay.** Each task they were assigned to is left with nobody
  assigned and a note of whose it was, such as "Nobody (was Ben)".

## The Team dashboard

`/team` holds three things:

- **Team settings.** Name, daily check-in time, time zone and work days. Each
  field saves when it is left or picked. There is no Save button. Members see
  the same card to read.
- **Members.** Everyone on the team with their role and the date they joined.
  The owner and admins change roles from the Settings button and remove people
  from the Delete button, one at a time or several at once.
- **Pending invites.** Only the owner and admins see this table. Each row can
  be sent again or cancelled.

People who aren't the owner also see a Leave team card at the bottom.

## Where it lives

- **Rules:** `src/server/project/teams.ts` and `src/server/project/invites.ts`.
- **Who may do what:** `src/server/project/access.ts`.
- **Screens:** `src/components/project/team-dashboard.tsx` and
  `src/components/project/team-start.tsx`.
- **Tests:** `src/server/project/project.test.ts`.
