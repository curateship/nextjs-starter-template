## UI Rules

- Prefer components from `src/components/ui/` over native HTML controls whenever a shadcn equivalent exists.
- Do not introduce custom modal, select, dropdown, button, input, table, or sheet styling when custom-shell already has a shadcn component for it.
- If a required shadcn component does not exist in `src/components/ui/`, add it there first, then use it in the page/component.
- All custom Ui changes will be in global.css and not in the Ui Component

## Forms

- Use shadcn form controls for inputs and interactions.
- Avoid native `<select>` and similar browser-default controls when a shadcn control should be used instead.

## Tables

- Use the shadcn table primitives from `src/components/ui/table`.
- Data tables should use the table primitive column props instead of repeating Tailwind column strings.
- Every data table should have one primary content column, such as title, name, message, or activity.
- The primary column uses `TableHead column="main"` and `TableCell column="main"`.
- Supporting columns use `TableHead column="meta"` and `TableCell column="meta"`.
- Muted supporting text, such as author or date, uses `TableCell column="mutedMeta"`.
- Small secondary snippets use `TableHead column="preview"` and `TableCell column="preview"`.
- Supporting columns stay compact, left-aligned, and should not compete with the primary column.
- Do not create two wide text columns in the same table.

## Refreshing Data After Changes

One approach, two cases:

- A dashboard that makes a change itself updates its own rows in place (the way
  the feedback and comments dashboards do after their own edits and deletes).
  No refetch is needed for your own change.
- A change made from a surface that floats over other pages — today that is the
  shell's feedback modal — must call its `onMutated` callback after **every**
  successful write (create, vote, comment add/edit/delete). The shell bumps
  `feedbackRefreshToken` in `useShellRuntime`, and every dashboard showing that
  data takes the token as a `refreshToken` prop and lists it in its fetch
  effect's dependencies, so it refetches and stays honest.

Dashboards on sibling routes unmount and refetch on navigation, so they never
need to signal each other directly. Do not invent a second mechanism (manual
cross-component `refresh()` calls, shared mutable stores); wire new shell-level
surfaces into the same token.

## Dashboard Filters

- Dashboard filter bars should use the dashboard toolbar primitives from `src/components/dashboard-toolbar`.
- Use `DashboardToolbar` for the header layout and `DashboardToolbarTitle` for the title/count area.
- Put search and dropdown filters inside `DashboardToolbarControls`.
- Use `DashboardToolbarSearch` for search inputs.
- Use `DashboardToolbarSelectTrigger` for dashboard filter dropdowns.
- Filter controls should wrap on mobile like the feedback dashboard instead of stacking into full-width rows.
