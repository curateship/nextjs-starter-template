# Overview  
System Everything Phase 1 - Multi-Site & Theme Architecture Platform

A Next.js-based multi-tenant platform that enables super admins to manage site owners and their websites through a unified admin interface. The platform focuses on providing a scalable foundation for multi-site management with flexible theming capabilities and modular block-based content creation.

This phase establishes the core multi-tenant architecture, authentication systems, and foundational site building capabilities while maintaining simplicity and avoiding over-engineering.

# Core Features  
## 1. Dual Authentication System
- **Super Admin/Admin Management**: Single table with role-based permissions (super_admin | admin) for platform-level operations
- **Site Owner Management**: Separate table for site owners with site-scoped operations to avoid complexity
- **Clean Separation**: No hierarchical user systems - simple CRUD operations for each user type
- **Future-Ready**: Architecture supports adding site users later without refactoring

## 2. File-Based Theme System with Database Customization
- **Hardcoded Themes**: Developer-controlled themes stored in `/app/themes/` for consistency and performance
- **Database Settings**: Site-specific customizations (colors, fonts, logos) stored in database for flexibility
- **Super Admin Controls**: Can edit any site's theme settings for support and compliance
- **Site Owner Customization**: Can customize their own site's appearance within defined parameters

## 3. Simple User Management (CRUD)
- **Super Admin Functions**: Create, read, update, delete site owner accounts
- **Site Owner Functions**: Manage their own sites and edit personal profile details
- **No Complex Hierarchies**: Focused on essential functionality for MVP validation

## 4. Multi-Site Management
- **Super Admin Oversight**: Full CRUD access to all sites across all site owners
- **Site Owner Control**: CRUD access limited to their own sites
- **Clean Data Separation**: Each site maintains independent configuration and content

## 5. Block-Based Site Builder (Layout Blocks)
- **Block Renderer Pattern**: Centralized rendering system using existing BlockRenderer.tsx architecture
- **Page-Specific Block Libraries**: Super admin controls which blocks are available for each page type (home, product, cart, etc.)
- **Home Page Focus**: Initial implementation starts with home page customization
- **Admin UI Pattern**: Uses existing card-based admin components (SiteBlock.tsx, BasicBlock.tsx patterns)

# User Experience  
## Super Admin Persona
- **Role**: Platform administrator managing the entire multi-tenant system
- **Goals**: Oversee site owners, manage themes, ensure platform consistency
- **Key Flows**: 
  - Create and manage site owner accounts
  - Configure available themes and block libraries
  - Monitor and support site owners
  - Manage platform-wide settings

## Site Owner Persona  
- **Role**: Business owner or manager creating and customizing their website
- **Goals**: Build and maintain their site with professional appearance
- **Key Flows**:
  - Create and configure their sites
  - Customize theme settings (colors, fonts, logos)
  - Build pages using available blocks
  - Manage their own profile and settings

## Site Builder User Flow
1. **Select Page** → Choose page to customize (starting with home page)
2. **Choose Blocks** → Select from page-appropriate block library
3. **Configure Blocks** → Use settings panels to customize content and appearance
4. **Preview Changes** → Live preview using BlockRenderer system
5. **Save and Publish** → Apply changes to live site

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Next.js 15.3.4** with App Router for modern React patterns
- **TypeScript 5** for type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for consistent styling
- **Existing Block System**: Leverages current BlockRenderer.tsx architecture

## Database Schema
### Authentication Tables
```sql
users_super_admins (table)
├── id, email, password_hash, role (super_admin | admin), created_at

users_tenant_roles (table)
├── id, email, password_hash, status, created_at

users_site_level (table) - future site users
├── id, email, password_hash, site_id, status, created_at

users_details (table)
├── user_id, user_type (admin_user | site_owner | user), 
    name, phone, avatar, bio, preferences

sites (table)
├── id, owner_id, name, domain, theme_id, status, created_at

site_settings (table)
├── site_id, theme_id, logo_url, primary_color, secondary_color, 
    font_family, font_size, background_color, header_text, footer_text
```

### Block System Tables
```sql
site_pages (table)
├── id, site_id, page_type (home, about, product, etc.), name, status

page_blocks (table)
├── id, page_id, block_type, position, config (JSON), active

page_block_libraries (table)
├── page_type, allowed_block_types (JSON)

layout_blocks (table)
├── id, name, type (layout_block_hero, layout_block_contact, layout_block_footer, etc.), 
    config_schema (JSON), active

module_blocks (table)
├── id, name, type (products_block_grid, posts_block_list, newsletters_block_signup, etc.), 
    config_schema (JSON), active
```

## Theme Architecture
- **File Structure**: `/app/themes/{theme-name}/` containing layout components and styles
- **Theme Integration**: BlockRenderer dynamically loads theme-specific components
- **Customization Layer**: Database settings override default theme values
- **Component Pattern**: Uses existing frontend/layout/ component architecture

## Block System Integration
- **Existing BlockRenderer**: `<BlockRenderer type="HeroBlock" config={{...}} />`
- **Page-Specific Blocks**: Block library restrictions prevent inappropriate block usage
- **Admin UI**: Leverages existing admin/modules/ component patterns
- **Block Categories & Locations**:
  - **Layout blocks**: `src/components/frontend/layout/` (user-editable with business logic)
  - **Content-specific blocks**: `src/components/frontend/modules/` (products, posts, newsletters, etc.)
  - **Admin blocks**: `src/components/admin/modules/` (management interfaces)
  - **UI components**: `src/components/ui/` (pure presentation components)

## 🔒 CRITICAL: Block Isolation Protocol
**⚠️ MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT RULE: When working on block components:**

1. **BLOCK-ONLY CHANGES**: Only modify the specific block component being worked on
2. **NO EXTERNAL CHANGES**: Do NOT modify files outside the block without explicit approval
3. **USER CONFIRMATION**: Get explicit approval before any changes outside the block scope
4. **ISOLATION FIRST**: Solve all problems within the block whenever possible
5. **COMPONENT EXTRACTION**: Break complex blocks into focused, single-purpose components within the block folder

**This isolation ensures:**
- Prevents cascading changes across the platform
- Maintains multi-tenant stability
- Enables safe parallel development
- Preserves existing functionality

## 🧩 Component Architecture Standards

### **Organization Principles**
- **Component Extraction**: Break large components into focused, single-purpose parts
- **Hierarchy**: Main component → direct dependencies → supporting components  
- **Clean Code**: Eliminate deep nesting and "ugly closing brackets"
- **Strategic Commenting**: Explain "why" not "what", avoid over-commenting

### **Code Structure Example**
```typescript
// Main component (clean, focused)
const SiteBuilderBlock = () => (
  <div className="site-builder">
    <BlockLibrary />
    <BlockConfigPanel />
    <PreviewArea />
  </div>
)

// Supporting components (extracted for clarity)
const BlockLibrary = ({ availableBlocks, onBlockSelect }) => (...)
const BlockConfigPanel = ({ selectedBlock, onConfigChange }) => (...)
const PreviewArea = ({ blocks, config }) => (...)
```

### **Formatting & Commenting Standards**
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define clear prop types for all components
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive component and variable names
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
- **Comment Intent**: Explain business logic and architectural decisions, not obvious code
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns from existing codebase
