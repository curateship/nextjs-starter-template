# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Uses Next.js with Turbopack for fast development
```

**Build and deployment:**
```bash
npm run build    # Build for production
npm start        # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

**Testing:**
No specific test commands configured. Check for testing setup before running tests.

## Architecture Overview

This is a **multi-tenant platform** for managing multiple sites with theme-based customization, built on Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router.

### Core Architecture Patterns

**Multi-Site Structure:**
- `/app/(main)/` - Main application routes with navbar/footer layout
- `/app/admin/` - Admin dashboard for platform management  
- `/app/themes/marketplace/` - Theme-specific layouts and components
- Each route group has its own layout system for proper theme isolation

**Component Organization:**
- `/src/components/admin/` - Admin dashboard components
  - `layout/` - Admin-specific layout components (sidebar, headers)
  - `modules/` - Feature modules (posts, products, sites, themes, users)
- `/src/components/frontend/` - Public-facing theme components
  - `layout/` - Theme layout components (navigation, footer)
  - `modules/` - Content modules (posts, products with theme variants)
- `/src/components/ui/` - Shared UI components (Shadcn/ui based)

**Block-Based Architecture:**
The platform uses a modular block system for content management:
- Layout blocks in `frontend/layout/` for structural components
- Content modules in `frontend/modules/` for specific content types
- Admin modules in `admin/modules/` for management interfaces
- Each block type has theme-specific variants

### Critical Development Rules

**ðŸ”’ Block Isolation Protocol** (from PRD):
1. **BLOCK-ONLY CHANGES** - Only modify the specific block being worked on
2. **NO EXTERNAL CHANGES** - Don't modify files outside block scope without approval
3. **USER CONFIRMATION** - Get approval for any changes outside block scope  
4. **ISOLATION FIRST** - Solve problems within the block whenever possible
5. **COMPONENT EXTRACTION** - Break complex blocks into focused components

### Database Schema (Planned)

**Authentication System:**
- `users_super_admins` - Platform administrators
- `users_tenant_roles` - Site owners  
- `users_site_level` - Future site-level users
- `users_details` - Shared user profile data

**Multi-Site Management:**
- `sites` - Site configurations and ownership
- `site_settings` - Theme customizations per site
- `site_pages` - Page definitions per site
- `page_blocks` - Block configurations per page

## Key Technologies

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 with custom design system
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Fonts:** Urbanist and Geist Mono via next/font
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights

## Development Patterns

**Theme System:**
- File-based themes in `/app/themes/{theme-name}/`
- Database customization for colors, fonts, logos
- Layout components use theme-specific implementations

**Component Extraction:**
- Break large components into focused, single-purpose parts
- Follow hierarchy: Main component â†’ dependencies â†’ supporting components
- Eliminate deep nesting and maintain clean code structure

**TypeScript Usage:**
- Path aliases configured: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Strict TypeScript configuration enabled
- Component props should be properly typed

## File Structure Context

The project follows a modular architecture designed for multi-tenancy:
- Admin routes are separate from public routes
- Theme isolation through dedicated route groups
- Component organization by function (admin/frontend/ui)
- Block-based content system for flexible page building

When working on this codebase, always consider the multi-tenant nature and maintain proper separation between admin, theme, and content components.
