### React Key Error and Undeletable Empty Block Issue - FIXED

**Problem:**
- React key errors in post editor: "Each child in a list should have a unique key prop"
- Undeletable empty/corrupted blocks appearing in post builder
- "Error reordering blocks" when trying to delete corrupted blocks

**Root Cause:**
Corrupted block data in database where blocks were missing required properties (`id`, `type`) or were `null`/`undefined`. This caused:
1. React key errors when trying to render invalid blocks
2. Undeletable empty blocks because they had no valid `id` or `type`
3. Reorder function failures when trying to delete corrupted blocks

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Visible Corruption Detection** - Show corrupted blocks as red warning boxes with ⚠️ icons instead of hiding them
2. **Direct Cleanup Function** - Added `handleCleanupCorrupted()` that permanently removes ALL corrupted blocks from database
3. **Authentication Fix** - Fixed "Access denied" error in `updatePostBlocksAction` by simplifying database queries
4. **TypeScript Error Fix** - Fixed animation preset type casting in `animated-group.tsx` that was causing server crashes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/usePostBuilder.ts` - Added cleanup function
- `src/components/admin/post-builder/BlockListPanel.tsx` - Added corrupted block visibility and cleanup
- `src/components/admin/post-builder/PostPreview.tsx` - Added corrupted block preview warnings  
- `src/lib/actions/posts/post-actions.ts` - Fixed authentication query
- `src/components/ui/animated-group.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript type casting
- `src/app/admin/posts/builder/[siteId]/page.tsx` - Connected cleanup function

**Result:**
✅ React key errors resolved  
✅ Corrupted blocks now visible and easily removable  
✅ One-click cleanup permanently removes all corruption from database  
✅ Server stability improved  
✅ No more "Error reordering blocks" messages

**Philosophy:**
Followed CLAUDE.md SIMPLICITY FIRST RULE - instead of complex validation and hiding problems, we made corruption visible and provided direct cleanup tools.
