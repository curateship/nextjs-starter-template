			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Supabase PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM setup task into 5 logical subtasks, including database creation, schema definition, Prisma configuration, migration system, and security policies. For each subtask, provide a detailed description, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex database architecture setup with multiple components (Supabase, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM) and requires creating 10+ tables with proper relationships, migrations, and security policies. The technical depth and critical infrastructure nature warrant a high complexity score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Supabase Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Supabase Authentication System implementation into 4 subtasks covering: basic auth setup and configuration, role-based access control, authentication flows (login/logout/reset), and middleware implementation. For each subtask, include detailed requirements, implementation steps, and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is a critical security component requiring careful implementation. The task involves multiple authentication flows, role-based access, middleware, and security considerations. It has dependencies on the database setup and impacts the entire application security model."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Create BlockRenderer Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the BlockRenderer infrastructure implementation into 6 subtasks covering: core renderer component, TypeScript type system, block registry, dynamic loading mechanism, error handling, and theme integration. For each subtask, provide detailed technical requirements, implementation approach, and testing strategy.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly complex architectural task that forms the foundation of the entire site builder. It requires advanced TypeScript knowledge, dynamic component loading, error boundaries, and a sophisticated type system. The implementation will directly impact the extensibility and maintainability of the entire application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the User Management System implementation into 4 subtasks covering: super admin management interfaces, site owner management, user profile functionality, and role-based access control UI. For each subtask, include detailed requirements, UI/UX considerations, and validation criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating CRUD operations for different user types with proper validation, role management, and data isolation. While complex, it follows standard patterns for user management systems and has well-defined requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Multi-Site Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Multi-Site Management System into 5 subtasks covering: site CRUD operations, tenant isolation implementation, site configuration management, domain management, and site analytics. For each subtask, provide detailed technical requirements, data models, and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing complex multi-tenant architecture with proper data isolation, which is challenging to get right. It involves multiple interfaces, tenant-scoped data access patterns, and security considerations across several dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Create Theme System Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Theme System Foundation implementation into 4 subtasks covering: theme structure and TypeScript support, database customization system, theme selection UI, and theme asset management. For each subtask, include detailed technical requirements, file structure, and implementation approach.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a flexible theme system requires careful architecture to support both file-based defaults and database customizations. The task involves TypeScript type definitions, component overrides, and integration with the block system, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Build Block-Based Site Builder for Home Page",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Block-Based Site Builder implementation into 5 subtasks covering: block library system, block configuration UI, block positioning and ordering, block templates, and live preview functionality. For each subtask, provide detailed technical requirements, UI/UX considerations, and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex drag-and-drop interface with configuration panels, live preview, and integration with the theme system. It requires sophisticated state management and UI interactions, making it highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Row Level Security (RLS) Policies",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Row Level Security implementation into 3 subtasks covering: tenant isolation policies, user role-based policies, and shared resource policies. For each subtask, provide detailed SQL policy definitions, testing scenarios, and security validation approaches.",
			"reasoning": "Security is critical and requires careful implementation. The task involves writing SQL policies for multiple tables with different access patterns based on user roles. Getting this right is essential for data isolation in a multi-tenant system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Create Admin Dashboard and Site Management UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Admin Dashboard and Site Management UI implementation into 4 subtasks covering: super admin dashboard, site owner dashboard, management interfaces, and responsive layouts. For each subtask, provide detailed UI/UX requirements, component structure, and data requirements.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple dashboard interfaces with metrics, management panels, and responsive layouts. While it requires significant UI work, it follows established patterns and builds on existing functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Monitoring System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Error Handling and Monitoring System implementation into 4 subtasks covering: component-level error boundaries, global error handling, error logging and reporting, and monitoring dashboard. For each subtask, provide detailed technical requirements, implementation approach, and testing scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive error handling system requires implementation at multiple levels (component, API, global) with proper reporting and monitoring. It's a critical infrastructure component that impacts the entire application reliability."
